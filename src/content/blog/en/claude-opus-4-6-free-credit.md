## What's New with Claude Opus 4.6

Anthropic released **Claude Opus 4.6**, their latest flagship model, in February 2026.

Key improvements include:

- **Major coding upgrades**: More careful planning, reliable operation in large codebases, and improved self-debugging and code review capabilities
- **1M token context window**: First Opus-class model to support 1 million token context (beta)
- **Better agentic persistence**: More reliable performance on long-running agentic tasks
- **Everyday work tasks**: Financial analysis, research, document/spreadsheet/presentation creation

The model achieves state-of-the-art scores on Terminal-Bench 2.0 (agentic coding), Humanity's Last Exam (multidisciplinary reasoning), and BrowseComp (information retrieval), among others.

## The $50 Free Credit Promotion

To celebrate the Opus 4.6 launch, Anthropic is offering existing paid subscribers **$50 in Extra Usage credits**.

### Eligibility

- **Claude Pro** or **Max** subscribers
- Must have subscribed **before February 4, 2026**

Team, Enterprise plans, and API users are **not** eligible.

### How to Activate

1. Go to [claude.ai/settings/usage](https://claude.ai/settings/usage)
2. Enable the **Extra Usage** option
3. If you already have Extra Usage enabled, the **$50 is applied automatically**

### Deadline

- Activate by **February 16, 2026, 11:59 PM PT**
- Credits are valid for **60 days** after activation

---

## Important Caveats

There are a few things to watch out for with this promotion.

### Auto-Billing Warning

This is the most important caveat. Once Extra Usage is enabled, **billing continues automatically after the $50 credit is depleted**. To avoid unexpected charges:

- Monitor your credit balance regularly, or
- Disable Extra Usage after consuming the credit

### Excluded Plans

To reiterate: **Team/Enterprise plans** and **API usage** are not covered by this promotion.

## Wrap Up

The $50 credit paired with Opus 4.6's improvements is a great opportunity to try the new model without extra cost — especially if you use Claude for coding or agentic workflows.

Just make sure to **check your auto-billing settings**. You don't want a surprise charge after the free credits run out.
