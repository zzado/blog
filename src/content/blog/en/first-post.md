Welcome to my new blog! 🚀

I built this from scratch using **Astro 5.0** and **Tailwind CSS 4.0**.
It's super fast, clean, and ready for content.

## Why Astro?

Astro is all about performance. It ships zero JavaScript to the client by default.

## Code Snippet

```javascript
console.log('Hello, World!');
```

Stay tuned for more updates!
