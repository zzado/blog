## Introduction

From May 24 to June 1, 2024, I spent 9 days exploring Sydney. I got a lot of help from other people's reviews while planning, so now it's my turn to share. Here's everything I discovered — restaurants, scenic spots, and tips that might save you some trouble.

## Restaurants

### 🥩 Chophouse Sydney ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

A steak restaurant near Circular Quay. Still think about it to this day. If I ever go back to Sydney, this is my number one must-revisit.

- Very popular with locals, so **book ahead via Google Maps**
- When seated, you choose between tap water and sparkling water (sparkling costs extra but is unlimited)
- Must-order: **Wagyu rump cap** — the beef has this creamy, almost milky richness that completely redefines what steak can taste like

### 🍕 Johnny Gio's Pizza Waterloo ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

A small pizza joint in Waterloo, south of Surry Hills. The food I missed most after returning home.

- My **all-time favorite pizza place**. We ate there twice, then ordered delivery after moving to a city hotel (eating in-store is better though)
- Google reviews rave about the garlic bread, and it is good, but the real star is **The Boss pizza**
- Not too salty — the beef mince and roasted vegetables pair beautifully

### 🦐 Kickin'Inn Zetland ⭐⭐⭐⭐

A seafood boil restaurant in Zetland, further south of Waterloo.

- Thought it was too salty and intense while eating, but couldn't stop thinking about it the next day — it's addictive
- Staff recommend the mixed **SHA-BANG** sauce, but it can be overwhelmingly intense for some palates
- Recommendation: **GARLIC CAJUN** — we ordered two flavors and this one was the clear winner

### 🍜 Wong Kee Fast Food ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

When it's chilly and you're craving a warm broth, this is the place. Located near World Square — perfect for a morning meal before Blue Mountains or desert tours.

- Must-order: **Chicken rice noodle soup** — tastes like a clean, homestyle chicken broth
- The famous Happy Chef nearby was decent, but if you prefer thin, silky rice noodles in a clean broth, Wong Kee wins

### 🍔 Burgers ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Beef burgers in Sydney are consistently good everywhere — the quality of Australian beef really shows.

- **Ribs & Burgers The Rocks** — at the entrance of The Rocks Market. Not mind-blowing, but solidly delicious
- **Bar Luca** — the one that got away. Next time, I'm grabbing a burger here and eating it at the Observatory while watching the sunset

### 🍦 Desserts

**Gelato Messina (Circular Quay)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I was never really into gelato, even in Europe. This place changed everything. Tastings available, so try before you buy.

- Ranking: White chocolate hazelnut > Macadamia crunch > Cookies & cream

**ANITA GELATO (Bondi Beach)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

- Watermelon mint — refreshing palate cleanser
- Hazelnut chocolate — the cookie crunch texture is amazing
- ⚠️ **Eat inside the shop before heading to the beach.** The wind melts it fast — you'll end up wearing it

## Travel Spots

### 1. Watsons Bay 🌅

The place I still see when I close my eyes.

![Watsons Bay at sunset](/blog/images/blog/sydney/watsons-bay-1.jpg)

Most people visit during the day for the coastal walk, but we overslept and ended up taking the ferry at **sunset**. Turned out to be the best decision.

The sunset, the harbor, the towering trees — it looked like a scene from a storybook. Daytime is beautiful too, but Watsons Bay at dusk is something else entirely.

> 💡 There's a fish and chips shop there. It's... fine. Just okay.

### 2. Sydney Observatory

They say every Korean tourist in Sydney ends up here, and it does feel that way. The Harbour Bridge and Opera House views are famous, but **the real recommendation is to walk deeper inside**.

You'll find a quiet, open field where you can see the western sky. The sunset views are breathtaking — worth more than the postcard harbor shots.

### 3. Ferry 🚢

The most memorable moment of the entire trip was **standing at the bow of a ferry heading toward Circular Quay**.

- The seats are comfortable, but **stand at the bow and face forward** — feel the wind and the speed
- That rush of cutting through the water is indescribable
- Note: each ferry has a different layout — some don't allow access to the front

### 4. Hyde Park & Royal Botanic Gardens 🌿

Two words for both: **bring a mat.**

Hyde Park had a saxophone player, and at the Botanic Gardens, we spent two hours lying on the grass doing absolutely nothing. The gardens are enormous — aim for **Fleet Steps** and walk from there until the Opera House view suddenly opens up on a wide lawn.

> ⚠️ The Botanic Gardens **close at 4 PM** (varies by season — check first). Security starts clearing people around 3:40 PM. Follow the crowd to the exit — the entrance you came in through might be locked!

### 5. Honestly... Everything Was Great

Every corner of Sydney was worth visiting. The harbor at Circular Quay, the alleyways of The Rocks, the waves at Bondi Beach... the entire city is one big travel spot.

## Tours

### Featherdale Wildlife Park + Blue Mountains

We did just one tour during the entire trip. Sydney's city center alone has so much to see that time runs short quickly.

- **Featherdale Wildlife Park** — hold a koala for photos (extra ~$15 AUD) and feed kangaroos. We debated including this and are so glad we did
- **Blue Mountains** — highly recommended, but bring **hand warmers** — it gets seriously cold
- At night, the Milky Way was spectacularly clear — the guide said it was one of the top 3 nights they'd seen

## Tips

### Weather

If weather forecasts are stressing out your planning, here's what worked for us:

- A week before departure, it showed rain all week. **Two days before, it suddenly changed to sunny**
- **The forecast from the day before departure is the most accurate**
- Strategy: plan *where* you want to go, but **don't fix dates** — decide on-site based on actual weather
- Use **BOM Weather** (Australia's official weather app) on location and book tours on the best day

### Useful Apps

## Looking Back

Nine days felt too short for everything Sydney has to offer. The sunset at Watsons Bay, the wind on the ferry, the lazy afternoon at the Botanic Gardens — these are the moments that will stay with me.

What makes Sydney special is that nature is always within reach. One ferry ride from downtown and you're at a beach. A short walk and you're in a park. Don't just rush from spot to spot — make time to sit and simply take in the scenery.

If I go back? I'm grabbing a Bar Luca burger, heading to the Observatory, and watching the sunset. That's mission number one for Sydney, round two.
