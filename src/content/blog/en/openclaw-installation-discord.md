## TL;DR

> Installed **OpenClaw**, a self-hosted AI agent platform, on a Mac mini and connected it to Discord. Thanks to the onboarding wizard, the whole process was surprisingly smooth!

---

## Background

I wanted more than just chatting with AI on a website. I wanted to **summon AI right from my messenger** — reading files, writing code, making Git commits, all on command. That's exactly what [OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai/) does.

OpenClaw is a self-hosted gateway that connects messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, and iMessage to AI agents. Since it runs on your own machine, your data stays with you and customization is unlimited.

I needed a machine that could run 24/7, so I picked up a **Mac mini** (M4) — got it for around $550 with a student discount! Low power consumption, compact size, and macOS being the most stable platform for OpenClaw made it a perfect fit.

---

## Process

### Step 1: Prerequisites

You need two things to run OpenClaw:

- **Node.js 22 or later**
- **AI model access** (Anthropic API key or Claude subscription)

```bash
node --version
# v22.x.x or higher
```

![Node.js version check](/blog/images/blog/node-version.png)

AI model options include:

- **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)** — $100/mo, for developers (includes API credits, recommended)
- **[Claude Pro](https://claude.ai/pro)** — $20/mo, for general users
- **[Anthropic API](https://console.anthropic.com/)** — Pay-as-you-go

### Step 2: Install OpenClaw

One line does it all:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
openclaw --version
```

![OpenClaw version check](/blog/images/blog/openclaw-version.png)

### Step 3: Onboarding Wizard

This is the key part. The `openclaw onboard` command walks you through all initial setup interactively.

```bash
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

![Onboarding wizard start](/blog/images/blog/onboard-wizard.png)

First, you'll see a **security warning**. AI agents can read files and execute commands, so it reminds you to be cautious. Select `Yes` if you understand the implications.

The wizard then guides you through each step:

#### Choosing Onboarding Mode

```bash
# Select onboarding mode
◇ Onboarding mode
→ QuickStart          # Recommended for first-timers!

# QuickStart default settings summary
┌ QuickStart ─────────────────────────╮
│                                      │
│  Gateway port:  18789                │
│  Gateway bind:  Loopback (127.0.0.1) │
│  Gateway auth:  Token (default)      │
│  Tailscale:     Off                  │
│  Direct to chat channels.            │
│                                      │
└──────────────────────────────────────╯
```

The Gateway runs locally on port 18789 with no external exposure — safe by default.

#### AI Model Setup

```bash
# Select AI model provider
◇ Model/auth provider
→ Anthropic

# Select auth method
◇ Anthropic auth method
→ Anthropic token (paste setup-token)

# Paste your setup-token
◇ Paste Anthropic setup-token
→ ****************************************
```

Select Anthropic, then paste the token generated by `claude setup-token`. I'm using **Claude Opus 4** as my default model.

#### Channel Selection — Discord!

```bash
# Select channel to connect
◇ Select channel (QuickStart)
→ Discord (Bot API)
```

![Onboarding channel setup](/blog/images/blog/onboard-flow.png)

Select **Discord** as your channel. The wizard handles the bot token input right there.

### Step 4: Create a Discord Bot

Create your Discord bot at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

**Steps:**

1. **New Application** → Enter app name (e.g., "OpenClaw Bot") → **Create**
2. Left menu **Bot** → **Reset Token** → Copy the token
3. Under **Privileged Gateway Intents**:
   - ✅ **Message Content Intent** — **Required!** Without this, the bot can't read messages
   - ✅ **Server Members Intent** — Recommended (needed for user name lookups)
4. **OAuth2 → URL Generator**:
   - Scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`
   - Bot Permissions: `View Channels`, `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, `Embed Links`, `Attach Files`, `Add Reactions`
5. Use the generated URL to invite the bot to your server

> ⚠️ Forgetting **Message Content Intent** will cause a `Used disallowed intents` error. Don't skip it!

### Step 5: Connect Discord to OpenClaw

Enter the bot token directly in the onboarding wizard:

```bash
# Enter Discord bot token
◇ Enter Discord bot token
→ ****************************************

# Configure channel access
◇ Configure Discord channels access?
→ Yes

# Select access mode
◇ Discord channels access
→ Allowlist (recommended)

# Enter allowed channels
◇ Discord channels allowlist (comma-separated)
→ Server/#Channel1, Server/#Channel2

# Channels resolved
┌ Discord channels ────────────────────────────╮
│                                               │
│  Resolved channels: #channel1, #channel2      │
│                                               │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

**Allowlist** mode is recommended. It explicitly specifies which channels the bot responds in, preventing unwanted responses.

Once configured, the wizard automatically installs and starts the Gateway service:

```bash
# Gateway service installation
◓ Installing Gateway service…..
✓ Installed LaunchAgent: ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist

# Status check
◇ Discord: ok (@Claw) (794ms)
  Agents: main (default)
  Heartbeat interval: 1h (main)
```

On macOS, it registers as a **LaunchAgent** for auto-start on boot!

### Step 6: Verify & Test

Check Gateway status:

```bash
openclaw gateway status
```

![Gateway status check](/blog/images/blog/gateway-status.png)

If you see `running`, you're good to go! 🎉

Open the web dashboard:

```bash
openclaw dashboard
```

Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:18789/` to access the Control UI, where you can chat with the AI directly.

Now try mentioning the bot in Discord:

```
@OpenClaw Hello!
```

If the bot responds, the integration is complete! You can also DM the bot, though first-time contact requires **pairing authentication**:

```bash
openclaw pairing approve discord <code>
```

---

## Result

My Mac mini now runs OpenClaw 24/7, and I can summon AI anytime from Discord. File reading, code writing, Git commits, web searches — all from a chat window.

What impressed me most was the **onboarding wizard's polish**. A few selections in the terminal and security setup, model connection, channel integration, and service registration are all done at once. Almost no need to manually edit JSON config files.

---

## Wrapping Up

OpenClaw turns the dream of "an AI assistant in my pocket" into reality. Self-hosted means you keep data sovereignty, and being open source (MIT) means unlimited customization.

In the next post, I'll share how I **built this very blog** with OpenClaw — pair programming with AI to create an Astro blog from scratch!
