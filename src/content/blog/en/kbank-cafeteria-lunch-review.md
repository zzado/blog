## Intro

When choosing lunch during a workday, I care most about whether I can stay focused in the afternoon. On this day, I picked a pasta menu at the Kbank cafeteria and decided to leave a short note on the overall meal quality and balance.

## Main

The tray included pasta as the main dish, with salad, soup, tortilla with sauce, and pickles on the side.

- Main: oil-based pasta
- Sides: cabbage salad, soup, pickles
- Extra: tortilla with sauce

Overall, the “main + side” balance was solid. The oil-based pasta felt relatively light, while the salad and pickles helped keep the flavor profile from becoming too repetitive. With soup included, the meal was also filling enough for a workday lunch.

What stood out was that the cafeteria managed to keep a pasta-based meal fairly clean and practical. It felt like a good option even on days with a packed afternoon schedule.

## Wrap-up

It was not a flashy restaurant-style meal, but it was a stable and satisfying work lunch. For cafeteria meals, the real value usually comes from the balance of price, speed, and satisfaction—and this menu delivered that balance well.

I plan to keep recording good cafeteria meals like this as a practical reference for busy weekdays.
